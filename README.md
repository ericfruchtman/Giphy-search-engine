# Giphy-search-engine

Eric Fruchtman

The main purpose of this project is to create a website with a search engine that can loop through GIPHY's API and display image results on the page. 
The home page contains a nav-bar at the top of the page that includes a search field where the user can search for GIF images of their choosing.
