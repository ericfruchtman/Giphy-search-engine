OVERVIEW
______________
The main purpose of this project is to create a website with a search engine that can loop through GIPHY's API and display image results on the page. 
The home page contains a nav-bar at the top of the page that includes a search field where the user can search for GIF images of their choosing.

USER STORIES
_______________
As a web developer, I wanted to create a search engine with a simple interface that can loop through the GIPHY API and display GIF image search results based on user input.

As a user I want to retrieve GIF images through a search engine so that I can share with friends.
